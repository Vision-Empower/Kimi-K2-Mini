# K2-Mini Project Status Report

## Current Status: Partially Working ⚠️

### What Works ✅
- Model weights successfully restored from backup (39.9GB)
- Model loads correctly on H100 GPU (uses ~40.6GB VRAM)
- Tokenizer functions properly
- Weight dimensions fixed (expert gates: 384→16)
- FP8 weights converted to FP16 for compatibility

### Known Issues ❌
1. **DynamicCache Incompatibility**: Generation fails due to API mismatch
2. **Missing Shared Expert Weights**: 72 shared expert weights are not present
3. **Weight Shape Mismatches**: Some expert gate weights have incorrect dimensions

### Quick Fix for Generation
Edit modeling_deepseek.py line 1657 to fix cache compatibility.

### Memory Requirements
- Model size: ~40GB (FP16)
- Recommended GPU: H100 80GB or A100 80GB
- Minimum VRAM: 48GB
