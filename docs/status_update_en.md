# Kimi-K2-Mini Project Status Update 📊

**Update Date**: July 12, 2025

## Project Overview

Kimi-K2-Mini is a compressed version of the 1.07T parameter Kimi-K2 model, reduced to 32.5B parameters and optimized for single H100 GPU deployment.

## 🎯 Completed Milestones

### 1. Model Conversion Toolchain
- ✅ **Intelligent Layer Selection**: L2 norm-based analysis selecting 24 most important layers from 61
- ✅ **Fast Conversion Mode**: Uniform layer selection for quick conversion
- ✅ **FP8 Compatibility Fix**: Resolved FP8 to FP16 conversion for 1,227 weights
- ✅ **Weight Dimension Auto-correction**: Gate weight correction from 384 to 16 experts

### 2. Successful Model Generation
- 📦 **Model Size**: 39.9GB (5 safetensors shards)
- 💾 **Memory Usage**: ~40.6GB VRAM (FP16 precision)
- 🔧 **Configuration**: Disabled shared experts (n_shared_experts=0)

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Transformers loading test scripts
- ✅ vLLM inference test scripts
- ✅ CloudExe GPU remote execution integration
- ✅ Weight fixing toolkit (scripts/fixes/)

## ⚠️ Current Challenges

### 1. Generation Functionality
- **Issue**: DynamicCache API incompatibility causing generation failure
- **Workaround**: Modify modeling_deepseek.py line 1657
- **Root Cause**: Transformers version mismatch with model code

### 2. Missing Weights
- **Missing**: 72 shared expert weights not included in conversion
- **Impact**: May affect model performance but doesn't prevent loading
- **Plan**: Next version will rewrite conversion to include shared experts

### 3. Inference Optimization
- **Status**: Model loads but generation efficiency not optimized
- **Goal**: Achieve 5-10x inference speedup
