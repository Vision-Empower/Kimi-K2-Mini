# Kimi-K2-Mini Project Status Update

## Date: 2025-07-14

### Project Goal
Compress Kimi-K2 (1.07T parameters) to K2-Mini (32.5B parameters) for single H100 GPU deployment.

### Achievements

1. **Model Compression Completed**
   - Successfully reduced from 1.07T to 32.5B parameters
   - Compressed 61 layers to 24 layers
   - Reduced experts from 384 to 16 per layer
   - Final model size: 39.83GB (FP16)

2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configured CloudExe for remote GPU access
   - Successfully accessed full H100 80GB GPU via CloudExe
   - Fixed multiple technical issues:
     - DynamicCache compatibility
     - Weight dimension mismatches
     - FP8 to FP16 conversion

3. **Model Loading Success**
   - K2-Mini loads successfully on H100
   - Memory usage: ~40.6GB
   - Loading time: ~30 seconds

### Current Issues

1. **Inference Failure**
   - CUDA assertion error during generation
   - Probability tensor contains invalid values (inf/nan/negative)
   - Missing 72 shared expert weights

2. **Root Causes**
   - Aggressive expert pruning (384 to 16) may have damaged model stability
   - Missing shared expert weights affect computation
   - Numerical precision issues during weight conversion

### Technical Findings

1. **Hardware Constraints**
   - Local GPU: H100 with MIG (only 10GB available)
   - CloudExe GPU: Full H100 80GB (working)
   - CPU Memory: 2TB (excellent for expert caching)

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Original Kimi-K2: 61 layers × 384 experts = 23,424 experts total
   - K2-Mini: 24 layers × 16 experts = 384 experts total
   - Compression ratio: 98.4% reduction in experts

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Short-term (Immediate)**
   - Use existing 32B models (Qwen2.5-32B, DeepSeek-V3)
   - Try 4-bit quantization on original Kimi-K2

2. **Medium-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Implement dynamic expert loading
   - Keep all 384 experts but load on-demand
   - Utilize 2TB CPU memory for expert caching

3. **Long-term (Research)**
   - Gradual compression: 1.07T → 500B → 200B → 100B → 32.5B
   - Knowledge distillation from Kimi-K2 to smaller model
   - Advanced routing optimization

### Next Steps

**Recommended: Dynamic Expert Loading**
- Keep all 384 experts per layer
- Implement LRU cache on GPU (32-64 experts)
- Store remaining experts in CPU memory
- Trade inference speed for model quality

### Lessons Learned

1. Model compression is challenging - 98% parameter reduction is too aggressive
2. MoE models need careful handling - Expert selection critically affects stability
3. Infrastructure matters - CloudExe enables full GPU access vs local MIG limitations
4. CPU memory is valuable - 2TB RAM opens possibilities for dynamic loading
